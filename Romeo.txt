But soft, what light through yonder window breaks.
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arrive fair sun and kill the envious moon
That is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.

It is my lady, oh it is my love.
Oh that she knew she were.
She speaks and yet speaks nothing.
What of that?

<End of memory>
